# SINGLEPLAYER QUAKE FOR MAC OS X

## 1—Engine

Download *Quakespasm* from [http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/download.htm]

Create a folder *Quake* wherever you might want it

Place the Quakespasm application inside this folder

Create a folder *id1* inside the Quake folder



## 2—Content

Follow either section 2.1 for the demo version or 2.2 for the full version



### 2.1—Demo

Download *pak0.pak* from [https://github.com/shaunlebron/blinky/blob/master/game/id1/pak0.pak?raw=true]

Place it in the id1 folder from earlier



### 2.2—Full Version

You will not be able to download Quake the usual way, as the version distributed with Steam is Windows-exclusive

This is fine, buy it anyways

Enter *steam://open/console* into your browser's search bar

Unless you have a family account (you probably don't) this should open Steam with its console enabled

At the top, select the Console tab and enter *download_depot 2310 2311 6053405624730600672*

Once the download is complete, go to *Library/Application Support/Steam* and open the folder *Steam.AppBundle*

Within this folder navigate to *Steam/Contents/MacOS/steamapps/content/app_2310/depot_2311*

This folder contains 7 different versions of the Quake executable

Ignore them all

Open the enclosed *Id1* folder and copy *PAK0.PAK* and *PAK1.PAK* to your id1 folder from earlier



## 3—Configuration

Quake by default has a lot of settings passed down from 1996

If your greatest pleasure is configuring things, type *cvarlist* into the console

Otherwise, go to [https://github.com/m0rrism0rris/misc/blob/main/quakespasm/config.cfg], right-click on the *Raw* button, and click *Save Link As*

Name it *config.cfg* and place it in the id1 folder


## 4—Soundtrack (OPTIONAL BUT YOU REALLY REALLY SHOULD)

You will probably want the soundtrack to Quake as well

Download it from [https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/quake_campaign_soundtrack.zip]

The zip should contain a folder named *id1*

Drag the files inside this folder to your own id1 folder



## 5—Lighting (OPTIONAL)

Quakespasm supports colored lighting, which greatly improves the atmosphere of the game

Download it from [http://www.quaketastic.com/files/misc/litvis_packs/id1_litvis.zip]

Place the *maps* folder it contains into your id1 folder

*You should now be ready to play Quake singleplayer.*

*Rip and tear! (That's Doom but whatever)*
