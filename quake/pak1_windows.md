## DOWNLOADING THE FULL VERSION OF QUAKE ON WINDOWS

Install Quake using Steam, like any other game

Right-click on Quake in the sidebar and select *Properties*

Go to the *Local Files* tab and select *Browse Local Files*

This folder contains 7 different versions of Quake

Ignore them all, unless your deepest desire is to relive the 1990s

If you wish, you can put your Quake engine of choice here, and save a bit of setup

Otherwise, open the enclosed *Id1* folder and copy *PAK0.PAK* and *PAK1.PAK* to your id1 folder from earlier

#

Finally, start up Quake and enjoy your new Realm of Black Magic, Netherworld, Elder World, and Deathmatches!
