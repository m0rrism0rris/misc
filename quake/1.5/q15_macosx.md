### INSTALLING QUAKE 1.5 ON MAC OS X
#### 1—Engine
Download the August 2018 build of *DarkPlaces* from <https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/darkplacesengine20180908beta1.zip>  
Create a new folder *DarkPlaces* wherever you might want (I suggest Applications)  
Extract the zip and place the enclosed *DarkPlaces.app* inside this folder  
Create a folder *id1* inside the DarkPlaces folder  

#### 2—Content
If you do not already have the full version of Quake, go to 2.1  
Otherwise, go to 2.2  

###### 2.1—Installing the full version of Quake
You will not be able to download Quake the usual way, as the version distributed with Steam is Windows-exclusive  
This is fine, buy it anyways  
Enter *steam://open/console* into your browser's search bar  
Unless you have a family account (you probably don't) this should open Steam with its console enabled  
At the top, select the Console tab and enter *download_depot 2310 2311 6053405624730600672*  
Once the download is complete, go to *Library/Application Support/Steam* and open the folder *Steam.AppBundle*  
Within this folder navigate to *Steam/Contents/MacOS/steamapps/content/app_2310/depot_2311*  
This folder contains 7 different versions of the Quake executable  
Ignore them all  
Open the enclosed *Id1* folder and copy *PAK0.PAK* and *PAK1.PAK* to your id1 folder from earlier  

###### 2.2—Installing Quake 1.5
Download Quake 1.5 from <https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/173517>  
If you do not have a way to extract 7z files, you will need a tool such as [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/)  
Extract the zip and drag the enclosed *quake15* folder to your DarkPlaces folder from earlier  
Download <https://github.com/m0rrism0rris/misc/releases/download/untagged-b0d81b9727e937c77f45/Quake15Hack.zip>  
Move it to your DarkPlaces folder and open *Quake15.app* to play the game!
