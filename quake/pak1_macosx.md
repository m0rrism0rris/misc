## DOWNLOADING THE FULL VERSION OF QUAKE ON MAC OSX

Enter this (without quotes) into your browser's search bar: [steam://open/console]

Unless you have a family account (you probably don't) this should open Steam with its console enabled

At the top, select the Console tab and enter (without quotes) 'download_depot 2310 2311 6053405624730600672'

Once the download is complete, go to Library/Application Support/Steam and open the folder Steam.AppBundle

Within this folder navigate to Steam/Contents/MacOS/steamapps/content/app_2310/depot_2311/Id1

Copy the PAK0.PAK and PAK1.PAK files to your id1 folder from earlier

#

Finally, start up Quake and enjoy the Realm of Black Magic, the Netherworld, the Elderworld, and the Deathmatch maps!
