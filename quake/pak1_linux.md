## DOWNLOADING THE FULL VERSION OF QUAKE ON LINUX

Enter *steam://open/console* into your browser's search bar

Unless you have a family account (you probably don't) this should open Steam with its console enabled

At the top, select the Console tab and enter *download_depot 2310 2311 6053405624730600672*

Once the download is complete, go to the folder specified in the Steam console

This folder contains 7 different versions of Quake

Ignore them all

Open the enclosed *Id1* folder and copy *PAK0.PAK* and *PAK1.PAK* to your id1 folder from earlier

#

Finally, start up Quake and enjoy your new Realm of Black Magic, Netherworld, Elder World, and Deathmatches!
