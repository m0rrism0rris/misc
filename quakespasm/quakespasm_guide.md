**QUAKE GUIDE (SINGLEPLAYER)**

#1--Engine

Download *Quakespasm* from [http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/download.htm]

Create a folder 'Quake' (without quotes) wherever you might want it

Place the Quakespasm application inside this folder

Create a folder 'id1' (without quotes) inside the Quake folder



#2--Content

Download 'pak0.pak' from [https://github.com/shaunlebron/blinky/blob/master/game/id1/pak0.pak?raw=true]

Place it in the id1 folder from earlier



##3--Configuration

Quake by default has a lot of settings passed down from 1996

To remedy this, go to [https://github.com/m0rrism0rris/misc/blob/main/quakespasm/config.cfg], right-click on the 'Raw' button, and click 'Save Link As'

Name it 'config.cfg' and place it in the id1 folder.



#4--Soundtrack (OPTIONAL BUT YOU REALLY REALLY SHOULD)

You will probably want the soundtrack to Quake as well.

Download it from [https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/quake_campaign_soundtrack.zip]

It should contain a folder named 'id1'

Drag the files inside this folder to your own id1 folder.



#5--Lighting (OPTIONAL)

Quakespasm supports colored lighting, which greatly improves the atmosphere of the game.

Download it from [http://www.quaketastic.com/files/misc/litvis_packs/id1_litvis.zip]

Place the 'maps' folder it contains into your id1 folder.



*You should now be ready to play Quake Singleplayer.*

*Rip and tear! (That's Doom but whatever)*
